# tetris
This is a simple html5 tetris game, a great practice for my html5 skills, I hope you enjoy it.
https://github.com/infusion/HTML5-Tetris and https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-tetris provide me a lot of insights in how to make a tetris game, they deserve some credits.

Improvements in the future (if I have time):
1. multiplayer support
2. scores ranking among all the players in the history
3. better UI effects! Like comboing, line clearing, scoring
4. better UX, like the way the tile is rotating, moving, etc.
