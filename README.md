# tetris
This is a simple html5 tetris game, a great practice for my html5 skills, I hope you enjoy it. [Play Tetris!](http://man123v1.itch.io/html5-tetris-game)
https://github.com/infusion/HTML5-Tetris and https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-tetris provide me a lot of insights in how to make a tetris game, they deserve some credits.

Improvements in the future (if I have time):
- multiplayer support
- scores ranking among all the players in the history
- better UI effects! Like comboing, line clearing, scoring
- better UX, like the way the tile is rotating, moving, etc.
